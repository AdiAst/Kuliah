hello Jett

2
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:07,133
have you ever tried using Linux

3
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:08,833
as your operating system

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,766
no I haven't

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,566
isn't it complicated to switch from Windows

6
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:16,199
it can be a bit different at first

7
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:18,266
but once you get used to it

8
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:20,166
it's pretty straightforward

9
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:23,399
what makes Linux different from Windows anyway

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,600
well for starters

11
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,433
Linux is open source

12
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:30,666
so you have more control over how your system operates

13
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:32,766
this sounds interesting

14
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,366
but how do you even get started with Linux

15
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:37,899
you can download a distribution

16
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,366
like Ubuntu or Fedora for free

17
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:42,366
and install it on your computer

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,166
oh I see

19
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,733
does it involve the same programs as Windows

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,300
not exactly

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,900
but there are plenty of alternatives available

22
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,466
and most basic software needs are covered

23
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:57,999
I might give it a try where can I learn more about it

24
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,133
there are lots of online tutorials and forms

25
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:02,333
dedicated to Linux

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,600
I can point you in the right direction

27
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,800
if you're interested

28
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,933
thanks that would be great

29
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,633
I'll let you know if I decide to make the switch

30
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:11,933
sure thing

31
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:15,333
I think you'll enjoy exploring the world of Linux
